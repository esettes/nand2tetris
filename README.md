### Build the computer hardware

My solution for the project nand2tetris. This first part of the project consist to build a basic simulated functional computer with the _Hardware simulator_ tool.


*I will be adding topics as I progress in the course*

## Chapters
- [Chapter 1: Boolean Logic](#Chapter_1)
- [Chapter 2: Boolean Arithmetic](#Chapter_2)

## Chapter 1: Boolean Logic

Starting with one primitive logic gate, *Nand*, and build all the other necessary logic gates, Not, And, Or, Xor, Mux and DMux.
The target computer will be designed to operate on 16-bit values, then 16-bit versions of the basic gates, like Not16,
And16, and so on, will also be build.
